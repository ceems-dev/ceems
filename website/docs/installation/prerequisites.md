# Prerequisites

There are no direct dependencies needed to install the CEEMS stack. However, CEEMS
is designed to work with a TSDB, and hence, [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) or
[Victoria Metrics](https://victoriametrics.com/)
must be available to store the scraped metrics.

The installation of Prometheus can be found in its [documentation](https://prometheus.io/download/),
and it is outside the current scope.
