# Prerequisites

There are no direct dependencies that are needed to install CEEMS stack. However, CEEMS
is designed to work with a TSDB and hence, [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) or
[Victoria Metrics](https://victoriametrics.com/)
must be available to store the scrapped metrics.

Installation of Prometheus can be found in its [docs](https://prometheus.io/download/)
and it is out of current scope.
