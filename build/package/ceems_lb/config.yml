# Load balancing strategy. Three possibilites
# - round-robin
# - least-connection
# - resource-based
# Round robin and least connection are classic strategies.
# Resource based works based on the query range in the TSDB query. The 
# query will be proxied to the backend that covers the query_range
strategy: resource-based

# Path to CEEMS API server DB. 
# The DB contains the information of user and projet units and LB will verify
# if user/project is the owner of the uuid under request to decide whether to
# proxy request to backend or not.
# db_path: /var/lib/ceems_api_server/ceems_api_server.db

# TLS is not supported for backends. CEEMS LB supports TLS and TLS terminates
# at the LB and requests are proxied to backends on HTTP. 
#
# LB and backend servers are meant to be in the same DMZ so that we do not need
# to encrypt communications. Backends however support basic auth and they can 
# be configured in URL with usual syntax.
backends:
  - url: "http://localhost:9090"
  # An example of configuring the basic auth username and password with backend
  # - url: "http://alice:password@localhost:9091"
