# Name. (required)
name: ceems_exporter

# Architecture. (required)
# This will expand any env var you set in the field, e.g. version: ${GOARCH}
# The architecture is specified using Go nomenclature (GOARCH) and translated
# to the platform specific equivalent. In order to manually set the architecture
# to a platform specific value, use deb_arch, rpm_arch and apk_arch.
# Examples: `all`, `amd64`, `386`, `arm5`, `arm6`, `arm7`, `arm64`, `mips`,
# `mipsle`, `mips64le`, `ppc64le`, `s390`
arch: "${GOARCH}"

# Platform.
# This will expand any env var you set in the field, e.g. version: ${GOOS}
# This is only used by the rpm and deb packagers.
# Examples: `linux` (default), `darwin`
platform: linux

# Version. (required)
# This will expand any env var you set in the field, e.g. version: ${SEMVER}
# Some package managers, like deb, require the version to start with a digit.
# Hence, you should not prefix the version with 'v'.
version: "${CEEMS_VERSION}"

# Maintainer. (required)
# This will expand any env var you set in the field, e.g. maintainer: ${GIT_COMMITTER_NAME} <${GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL}>
# Defaults to empty on rpm and apk
# Leaving the 'maintainer' field unset will not be allowed in a future version
maintainer: Mahendra PAIPURI <mahendra.paipuri@gmail.com>

# Description.
# Defaults to `no description given`.
# Most packagers call for a one-line synopsis of the package. Some (like deb)
# also call for a multi-line description starting on the second line.
description: A Prometheus exporter to scrape metrics of compute units

# Vendor.
# This will expand any env var you set in the field, e.g. vendor: ${VENDOR}
# This is only used by the rpm packager.

# This may lead to issues if these files are checkout out in Git, for example,
# as it won't keep all the permissions on fresh checkouts, or if the local
# system has a problematic umask setting.

# This setting allows to set the umask for all files that are added to the
# package without a specific file_info.mode set.
