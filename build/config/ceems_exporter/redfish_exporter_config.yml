# This is a sample configuration file for redfish collector
# to fetch the power consumption readings from redfish API server
#
redfish_web_config: {}
  # # Protocol of Redfish API server. Possible values are http, https
  # #
  # protocol: https

  # # Hostname of the Redfish API server. The hostname can accept
  # # a `{hostname}` placeholder which will be replaced by the current hostname
  # # at runtime.
  # #
  # # For instance, if a compute node `compute-0` has BMC hostname setup at
  # # `compute-0-bmc`, it is possible to provide hostname in the config as
  # # `{hostname}-bmc`. At runtime, the placeholder `{hostname}` will be replaced
  # # by actual hostname which is `compute-0` and we gives us BMC hostname 
  # # `compute-0-bmc`. This lets the operators to deploy exporter on cluster 
  # # of nodes using same config file assuming that BMC credentials are also same 
  # # across the cluster.
  # #
  # # If the hostname is not provided, the collector is capable of discovering
  # # BMC IP address by making a raw IPMI request to OpenIPMI linux driver.
  # # This is equivalent to running `ipmitool lan print` command which will
  # # give us BMC LAN IP. This is possible when Linux IPMI driver has been
  # # loaded and exporter process has enough privileges (CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE).
  # #
  # hostname: compute-0-bmc

  # # Port to which Redfish API server binds to.
  # #
  # port: 443

  # # External URL at which all Redfish API servers of the cluster are reachable.
  # # Generally BMC network is not reachable from the cluster network and hence,
  # # we cannot make requests to Redfish API server directly from the compute nodes.
  # # In this case, a reverse proxy can be deployed on a management node where
  # # BMC network is reachable and proxy the incoming requests to correct Redfish
  # # API server target. The `external_url` must point to the URL of this reverse
  # # proxy.
  # #
  # # CEEMS provide a utility `redfish_proxy` app that can do the job of reverse
  # # proxy to Redfish API servers.
  # #
  # # When `external_url` is provided, collector always makes requests to
  # # `external_url`. Even when `external_url` is provided, Redfish's web
  # # config like `protocol`, `hostname` and `port` must be provided. 
  # # Collector will send these details via headers to `redfish_proxy` so
  # # that the proxy in-turn makes requests to correct Redfish target
  # #
  # external_url: http://redfish-proxy:5000

  # # Username that has enough privileges to query for chassis power data.
  # #
  # username: admin

  # # Password corresponding to the username provided above.
  # #
  # password: supersecret

  # # If TLS is enabled on Redfish server or Redfish Proxy server 
  # # with self signed certificates, set it to true to skip TLS 
  # # certificate verification.
  # #
  # insecure_skip_verify: false

  # # If this is set to `true`, a session token will be request with provided username
  # # and password once and all the subsequent requests will use that token for auth.
  # # If set to `false`, each request will send the provided username and password to
  # # perform basic auth.
  # #
  # # Always prefer to use session tokens by setting this option to `true` as it avoids
  # # sending critical username/password credentials in each request and using sessions
  # # is more performant than making requests with username/password
  # #
  # # When sessions are used, ensure the session timeout is more than the scrape interval
  # # of the Prometheus. Otherwise the session will be invalidated before the next scrape
  # # and thus every scrape creates a new session which is not optimal.
  # # As a recommendation, use a session timeout twice as big as scrape interval to avoid
  # # situations described above.
  # #
  # use_session_token: true
