# Pyroscope

This is a basic Pyroscope config that can be used to deploy
Pyroscope server on a single node in monolithic mode to ingest
profiling data. This config uses local or network filesystem
as storage backend to store profiling data.

More options on Pyroscope server configuration can be found in
the [official docs](https://grafana.com/docs/pyroscope/latest/configure-server/reference-configuration-parameters).
