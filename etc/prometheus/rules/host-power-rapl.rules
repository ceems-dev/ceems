# Recording rules for scrape job <job>
#
# The following recording rules provide several CPU related metrics of the individual
# compute units. Each of these metrics involving multiple raw metrics to compute them.
# Performing such queries involving multiple metrics is a computational intensive
# operation for Prometheus and hence, we leverage recording rules to estimate them
# in the real time and store them in the TSDB. The downside of this approach is that
# it creates new metrics which consume more space. However, we add atmost 10 new metrics
# which should not increase the disk use of TSDB enormously.
#
# Placeholders to replace:
# <job>: Prometheus job name
# <gpu_job>: Prometheus job name under which DCGM exporter is running on the same host
